# SyncingBoard Architecture & System Design

SyncingBoard is a stateless design-to-canvas sync engine designed to fetch, render, and update screenshots in-place on whiteboards. It supports **Figma** and **Penpot** as design sources, **Miro** as the primary canvas target, a shipped **FigJam app** target (M1), and further platforms under research.

### Why Stateless?

SyncingBoard is deliberately built as a stateless proxy engine for key technical, security, and operational reasons:

* **Privacy-First Security Model:** We never store raw Figma or Miro access tokens, credentials, or design screens on our servers. Rate limiting identifies callers using anonymous, one-way SHA-256 token fingerprints (`tok:sha256(token)`) from which original access tokens can never be recovered. Your intellectual property remains strictly within your design tools.
* **Third-Party Cookie Resilience:** Miro plugins operate inside sandboxed browser iframes where modern browsers block third-party cookies. Storing tokens client-side within the active Miro session avoids iframe cookie restrictions entirely.
* **Enterprise Compliance Exemption:** Storing zero personal data or design files bypasses GDPR Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), right-to-be-forgotten pipelines, and complex Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) for enterprise security reviews.
* **Zero Infrastructure Overhead:** Operating database-free allows self-hosters and design teams to deploy SyncingBoard in minutes on serverless hosts (like Vercel) with zero database management or storage costs.
* **Self-Healing Serverless Scale:** Serverless functions scale instantly from 0 to 10,000 requests/minute and back to 0 without database schema migrations, connection pool limits, or cold-start latency.
* **Seamless Board Collaboration:** Frame pairing metadata is stored directly inside Miro widget properties (`title`). This enables any teammate on the board to sync design updates without requiring complex multi-user database permissions.

### Architectural Trade-Offs

While statelessness delivers maximum privacy and zero infrastructure overhead, it involves deliberate technical trade-offs:

* **Client-Scoped Sessions:** OAuth tokens live in client-side Miro board metadata; clearing browser data or moving to an un-paired browser requires re-authenticating.
* **Payload Constraints:** Without server-side cloud storage (S3), image transfers travel directly via serverless HTTP response bodies and are subject to host payload limits (4.5MB on Vercel).
* **No Historical Sync Activity:** SyncingBoard retains no historical user activity logs, past sync dashboards, or permanent audit histories.

## Architectural Principle: Adapter Layers

SyncingBoard is organized into three adapter layers, each interchangeable:

```mermaid
graph TD
  agents["AI Agents / Automation<br/>(Claude Desktop, Cursor, pi, scripts)"]
  subgraph engine["SyncingBoard Core Engine"]
    direction LR
    sa["Source Adapters<br/>(Figma / Penpot / etc.)"]
    ta["Target Adapters<br/>(Miro / Mural / etc.)"]
    mcp["MCP Client (Planned)"]
    lovable["Lovable<br/>MCP HTTP"]
    stitch["Stitch<br/>MCP stdio"]
    sa --> ta
    sa -.->|MCP Client| mcp
    mcp --> lovable
    mcp --> stitch
  end
  ta --> miro["Miro"]
ta --> figjam["FigJam App<br/>(M1 - Shipped)"]
  ta --> mural["Mural"]
  ta --> wb["WB"]
  agents -->|"MCP Server (Planned)"| engine
```

Each adapter implements a uniform interface. Adding a new source means writing a new source adapter; adding a new target means writing a new target adapter. The transport and security layers are shared across all components.
