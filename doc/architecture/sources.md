# Source Adapters Architecture

> **Overview:** SyncingBoard reads design data from source design tools through platform-specific adapters. Two are implemented (**Figma**, **Penpot**); five more are under research (**UXPin**, **Framer**, **Lovable**, **Stitch**, **Adobe UXP**).

**Implementation Note (v0.13.3):** While `SyncSourceAdapter` represents the target architectural interface for future integrations (Lovable, Stitch), `v0.13.3` currently implements Figma and Penpot directly via custom serverless endpoints (`/api/figma/...`, `/api/relay/...`) and dedicated React importer hooks (`useFigmaImporter`, `usePenpotImporter`).

## Figma — Cloud-Native REST + Companion Relay

Figma provides a robust public web API that renders design frames to images in the cloud (`api.figma.com/v1/images`), while offering an optional WebSocket companion plugin for live selection broadcasting.

* **Image Sync Flow:** The Miro plugin requests frame renders via `/api/figma/render-batch`. The server requests the frame render directly from Figma's cloud REST API (`api.figma.com/v1/images`), downloads the image bytes, and uploads them to the Miro widget via multipart POST.
* **Selection Relay Flow (Ably WebSocket):** When running the companion plugin inside **Figma Web (`figma.com`) or Figma Desktop**, `figma.on('selectionchange')` listens for canvas selections. It broadcasts selected frame metadata (`id`, `name`, `fileKey`) over an Ably WebSocket channel (`penpot:${pairingId}`) directly to the Miro plugin sidebar with zero server polling and zero Redis overhead.
* **Companion Scope:** Unlike Penpot (which relies on its companion plugin for rendering), **Figma ONLY requires the companion plugin for live selection detection**. Frame rendering, metadata extraction, and image syncing work 100% cloud-native via Figma's REST API without installing or running the companion plugin.
* **Manual Link Fallback:** If the companion plugin is not open in Figma, designers can manually paste any Figma frame URL into the Miro plugin sidebar to import and sync.
* **Benefits:** Zero user configuration, no local servers, and no tunnels required for private setups.

### The Cloud Key Limitation (Figma Community Restriction)
Figma enforces access control on `figma.fileKey` in its client-side plugin API:
* **Private/Organization Plugins:** Can query `figma.fileKey` automatically by setting `"enablePrivatePluginApi": true` in `manifest.json`.
* **Public/Community Plugins:** Figma blocks access to `figma.fileKey` (returns `undefined`) to preserve document privacy.
* **The Metadata Workaround:** To support public community installations, SyncingBoard implements a document-level linking bridge:
  1. The first time a Figma file is opened, the user pastes the Figma URL once in the Companion UI.
  2. The plugin extracts `fileKey` and saves it in document metadata using `figma.root.setPluginData('syncingboard_file_key', fileKey)`.
  3. This metadata persists within the `.fig` file in Figma's cloud, enabling companion selection auto-detection.

## Penpot — Cloud Relay + Companion Plugin

> **Status:** stable — implemented in production.

Unlike Figma, Penpot does **not** provide a public cloud REST API for rendering frames into PNG/SVG. Syncing Penpot designs uses an event-driven cloud relay to coordinate the designer's active Penpot browser tab:

* **The Cloud Limitation:** Rendering Penpot designs in the cloud would require booting a headless browser instance (Puppeteer/Playwright), loading the heavy WebAssembly editor, and taking screenshots — requiring expensive compute nodes.
* **The Event-Driven Relay Solution:** SyncingBoard uses the designer's **active Penpot browser tab** as the renderer, coordinated via **Ably WebSockets** for instant real-time delivery and an ephemeral **Upstash Redis** cache for heavy binary result storage.
* **Direct Selection (0 Redis Commands):** Selection payloads (`id`, `name`, `fileKey`) are published directly over the Ably WebSocket channel back to the Miro plugin sidebar, bypassing Redis entirely.
* **Hybrid Image Storage (Single-Read Redis):** Heavy PNG/SVG renders are posted to `/api/relay/penpot/result` (stored in Redis with a 180s TTL) and a tiny `'result-ready'` notification event is published over Ably. The Miro plugin receives the WebSocket event and reads/deletes the image with a single `GET /api/relay/response` call (3 Redis commands total per export: 1 SET, 1 GET, 1 DEL).

### Penpot Export Freeze & `openPage` Navigation Workaround

> **API Definition:** `penpot.openPage(pageId)` is an asynchronous browser API method provided natively by **Penpot's Plugin JavaScript SDK** (`@penpot/plugin-types`). It programmatically switches the active page view inside Penpot's WebAssembly canvas editor.

To save RAM, Penpot only loads the active page into WebAssembly (WASM) rendering memory. Background pages remain unparsed in storage.

* **Why Unopened Pages Freeze Penpot:** Exporting a shape from an un-hydrated background page forces Penpot to parse and calculate the entire background page tree synchronously on the browser's main JavaScript thread. This locks up the browser tab for **10 to 60 seconds** (triggering Chrome's *"Page Unresponsive"* dialog).
* **The 3-Step `openPage` Preload Solution:**
  1. **Preload (`await penpot.openPage(targetPage)`)**: The plugin switches to the target shape's page first, triggering Penpot's native page loader to hydrate WASM memory asynchronously in **~0.5s**.
  2. **Hot Export (`await shape.export()`)**: With the page active in WASM memory, `shape.export()` reads from hot cache and completes in **< 1s** with zero main-thread freezing.
  3. **Restore View (`await penpot.openPage(originalPageId)`)**: Immediately after capturing the binary image ArrayBuffer, the plugin navigates back to the designer's original page view automatically.

```javascript
// Step 1: Preload target page into WASM memory
if (shapeIsOnBackgroundPage) {
  await penpot.openPage(targetPage);
}

// Step 2: Fast export from hot WASM memory (< 1s)
const result = await shapeFromPage.export({ type: format, scale });

// Step 3: Return designer to original page
await penpot.openPage(originalPageId);
```

## UXPin (Research Target)

UXPin offers a REST API and a client-side JavaScript plugin system:
* **Cloud-Native Path (Figma pattern):** REST API supports project-level export (`GET /api/v1/projects`), but lacks per-frame batch rendering endpoints.
* **Cloud-Relay Path (Penpot pattern):** Plugin API runs inside the editor, reads selected nodes, and exports canvas surfaces. Requires verification of per-node export API surface.

---

## Framer (Research Target)

Framer pivoted to a website builder and exposes a client-side Plugin API and a server-side WebSocket API:
* **Plugin API:** Exposes selection detection (`subscribeToSelection`), node property reading (`getNode`), and asset importing (`addImage`), but lacks an export/render API for draft designs.
* **Server API:** Bidirectional streaming WebSocket for managing published sites (`publishPreviewLink`, `promoteToProduction`).
* **Verdict:** Pre-deployment frame sync is unviable without headless browser infrastructure. Post-deployment website screenshots via published `.framer.site` URLs are viable for whole-page reviews.

## Lovable — MCP HTTP Integration (Research Target)

Lovable (formerly GPT Engineer) provides an official HTTP MCP server (`mcp.lovable.dev`):
* **MCP Tools:** `get_project` returns project details, preview URL, and direct server-rendered screenshots without Puppeteer or client-side rendering infrastructure.
* **Sync Modes:** Supports static image sync (pushed to Miro image widget) or live embed link cards inserted into Miro.

---

## Stitch — Google MCP Integration (Research Target)

Google Stitch community MCP server (`stitch-mcp`):
* **MCP Tools:** `fetch_screen_image` downloads high-res screen renders directly from Google Stitch API.
* **Transport:** stdio process or hosted TCP bridge, authenticated via Google Cloud Application Default Credentials (ADC).

---

## Adobe UXP (Research Target)

Adobe UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) for Photoshop / Illustrator:
* **Cloud Storage API Path:** `GET /files/{assetId}/image-rendition` offers cloud-native document rendition retrieval.
* **UXP Plugin Path (Tauri-dependent):** UXP plugin inside Photoshop/Illustrator reads active selections and exports PNG/SVG files relayed to Tauri local sockets.

## Headless CMS (Research Target)
 
Headless Content Management Systems (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi, Notion):
* **API Integration:** Direct REST / GraphQL client integration to pull structured content models, rich text fields, and asset media URLs.
* **Canvas Use Cases:**
  * **In-Place Copy Hydration:** Replaces placeholder text on Figma/Penpot design components with live production copy.
  * **Multi-Locale Visual Auditing:** Generates side-by-side translated screens on Miro (e.g., German, Japanese, Spanish) to preview text overflow and layout bounds before engineering implementation.
  * **Title Signature:** `[CMSSync|provider|spaceId|entryId]` enables stateless tracking directly on the whiteboard canvas.
